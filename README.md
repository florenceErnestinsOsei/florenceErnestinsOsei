### Hi there 👋🏾

it's Florence! (she/her) I'm a passionate and results-oriented IT professional with a knack for automating infrastructure in fast-paced environments. Think about building scalable applications with ease using containerization (Docker, Kubernetes) and managing them on cloud platforms like AWS and Azure. More so my diverse background in technical support, web design, and software development skills gives me a well-rounded perspective and allows me to thrive in multitasking situations.
